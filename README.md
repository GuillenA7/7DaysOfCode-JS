# 7DaysOfCode - JavaScript

This repository contains my solutions to the **7 Days of Code** challenge by [Alura](https://7daysofcode.io/).  
The goal of this challenge is to strengthen programming logic using **JavaScript** with daily tasks.  

## 📅 Progress

- **Day 1:** Boolean operations and equality comparisons (`==` vs `===`)
- **Day 2:** User input with `prompt`, storing values in variables, and conditional responses
- **Day 3:** Control flow structures (`if`, `else`, `while`) to create an interactive programming career choice game
- **Day 4:** Number guessing game with loops and random number generation (`Math.random()`)
- **Day 5:** Shopping list creator using arrays and categories, with user input and grouped output
- **Day 6:** Added the ability to remove specific items from the shopping list, using array methods (`indexOf`, `splice`)
- **Day 7:** [To be completed]

## ▶️ How to Run

All solutions are written in **Node.js**.  
To run any file, first install the dependency `prompt-sync` (only once per repo):

```bash
npm install
```

Then execute the day you want to try, e.g.:

```
node day5.js
```
